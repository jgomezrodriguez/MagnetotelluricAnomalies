# MagnetotelluricAnomalies
A routine to estimate the temporal variation of AR (Apparent resistivity) from MT records.

This routine takes electric potential in perpendicular directions and triaxial magnetic records to obtain the apparent resistivity. 
This apparent resistivity is also depicted as anomaly values against (period of the sounding and the surface depth).
